(Frontend of Contacts Manager App)

I built a webapp where users can manage their contacts :)

**Stack:** Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, React, JavaScript, BootStrap, Postman, and Toast

MVP Features:
* Add a new contact
* Add media for each contact
* Get contact
* Update contact info
* Delete contact by id
* Pagination
* Toast Notifications

**Future Plans:**

* Work on Auth

* Implement OAuth Integration to seamlessly track contacts across devices and services

* Add more employee api endpoints

* Unit testing

* Dockerize 

* Incorporate Spring Security, adding roles, privileges, and authorization
